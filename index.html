             In your Android smartphone, the strength of mobile Internet signal is shown using alphabet letters like G, E, 
			 2G, 3G, H and 4G near the signal bar. These symbols are visible right next to the signal strength indicator. 
			 Have you ever wondered about the meaning of these symbols / letters?

              GPRS is considered to be the second generation (2G) mobile technology. It is the slowest and oldest among all 
			  mobile technologies. It is mainly good enough for sending text messages using apps like WhatsApp. Data rates 
			  in GPRS are between 56 and 114 kbit/second.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
             Letter E stands for EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution). It is also called Enhanced GPRS. This technology 
			 lies somewhere in between 2G and 3G technology. So, some people refer to it as 2.5G.

			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/1.jpg">
            <p class="text">
              EDGE is faster than GPRS but still not good enough to browse the Internet.Typically EDGE provides a data rate of 
			  400 kbit/second but in ideal conditions data rate of upto 1 Mbit/second can also be achieved.
            </p>
			<p class="text">
              This technology also lies somewhere in between 2G and 3G. Those who call GPRS as 2.5G, they refer EDGE as 2.75G.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
             3G means the third generation of mobile telephone technology. It uses the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System 
			 and is based on GSM standards.
            </p>
			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/3.jpg">
            <p class="text">
              Typically 3G provides data transfer rates 384 kbit/second. But depending upon how it is implemented in various 
			  networks, the data rate can go upto 42 Mbits/second.
            </p>
			<p class="text">
              Usually 3G is faster than EDGE and you can easily browse websites and stream music.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
             H stands for HSPA (High Speed Packet Access). It is an enhanced form of 3G technology. HSPA provides higher data 
			 transfer rates than the basic 3G.
            </p>
			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/2.png">
            <p class="text text-italic">
              Note: In the above comparison chart, all the data speeds are given in terms of bits (e.g. kilobits, megabits etc.)
			  In order to get the speed in terms of bytes (e.g. kilobytes, megabytes etc.) you would need to divide the shown 
			  figures by 8. One byte = 8 bits. 
            </p>
			<p class="text">
              HSPA can provide peak data rates of up to 14 Mbit/s for downlink and 5.76 Mbit/s for uplink.
            </p>
			<p class="text">
              High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is a further enhanced version of HSPA. HSDPA supports download speed of 
			  up to 99.3 Mbit/s. When you see letter H near the signal bar in your mobile phone, you can stream music and even 
			  YouTube videos without much interruption.

            <p class="text">
             This is enhanced HSPA. It is faster than basic HSPA (as explained above). Relatively speedier data transfer in H+ will 
			 make your video to download or stream much more smoothly.
            </p>
			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/h.jpg">
			<p class="text">
              At present, 4G technology is not very widely available. So, in most parts of the world, HSPA+ is the fastest speed you 
			  can get through mobile Internet.

            <p class="text">
             4G is the fourth generation of mobile technology. It is also called LTE (Long Term Evolution). 4G connection works as 
			 good as a wi-fi connection of your home or office.
            </p>
			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/4.jpg">
			<p class="text">
              LTE uses two different radio links for downlink and uplink â€” from tower to device and vice versa. For the downlink, 
			  LTE uses an OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access), which requires MIMO. MIMO, which stands for 
			  Multiple Input, Multiple Output, uses two or more antennas to reduce latency significantly and boost speeds within 
			  a given channel.

             5G is the 5th generation mobile network. It will take a much larger role than previous generations. 5G is also

			<img class="image center max-width-400" src="img/5.jpg">

              5G is expected to deliver peak data rates up to 20 Gbps. 5G also support new services such as mission-critical
